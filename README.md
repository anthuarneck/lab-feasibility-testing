# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Take the time to read back the work, and edit what you've written so that your answers are clear and anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will check the feasibility of two app ideas and determine a better option for a 2-day hack-a-thon project.

The hack-a-thon starts on a Friday. You spend 2 hours meeting your group, coming up with ideas, and planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday, with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways daily?

A user will round up the amount spent for every purchase made and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user must manually enter the amounts in the app. But eventually, connecting to banks and credit cards to automate the process would be the next step.

- What technologies are needed?

> React

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Possibly

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A user will be able to manually input savings amount into a savings account.
A user will be able to check the amount of money they have in their savings account.

- What are the app milestones

> CRUD functionality, actually implementing bank connectivity

- What other things need to be considered about this app?

> User protection, accuracy once app is automated, overall automation process

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> Probably not.

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> The app will have a user manually input their savings amount and also have a user manually input the amount they are adding to savings. Savings amount will then readjust based on amount added.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Some sort of reward system can be implemented. A user can gain x amount of currency based on x amount of currency saved with this app.

- How could people misuse this application?

> If original idea is implemented, sensitive info can possibly be stolen.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> This app will have to track very sensitive user data, there can be potential safety issues.

> **Note**: For a hack-a-thon, imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely; what if they could get on a chat app, select a topic, and be randomly matched with someone who wants to discuss the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly, etc.). They are matched with another person and can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their discussion.

It is anonymous; no pictures, real names, or locations are shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).

- What technologies are needed?

> Database, React

- Would you have to learn a new technology?

> Yes, database

- What would MVP look like (use user stories)

> A user will be able to connect with another user to discuss a topic via text/voice chat.
A user will be able to select a topic of interest to discuss.
A user will be able to decide on whether they want to chat on voice call or text.

- What are the app milestones

> User to user connectivity, CRUD functionality for messaging

- What other things need to be considered about this app

> Safety, meetups should be discouraged as bad users may be on app. Report system for bad users.

- Is this app idea feasible for a hack-a-thon?

> I believe so

- Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> Voice call feature can be taken away.

- How could you encourage users to interact with this app regularly?

> Users can unlock special icons or in app cosmetics based on how many conversations theyve had.

- How could people misuse this application?

> A bad user can try to get sensitive info from other users.

- Are there any safety issues with this application?

> There should be no safety issues as users are anonymous.
